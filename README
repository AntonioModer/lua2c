lua2c - converts Lua source code to C code.

== Description

The compiler is written entirely in Lua and converts Lua source code
to C code using C API calls.

WARNING: This code is in development and should be considered
experimental.  It does successfully convert Lua's "bisect.lua"
example, but it is otherwise incomplete, so dig into the code and fix
anything that's not implemented or broken.  This code can be made
robust for a large subset of Lua.  Please report bugs/patches on the
wiki.

Example usage:

  lua lua2c.lua examples-lua/bisect.lua

You may also use the shell script "lua2c" to compile Lua->C->machine
code and execute all in one step.  However, you may need to edit the
variables in the file to match your system.

This project reuses Metalua's gg/mlp parser to convert Lua source to a
Metalua-style[1] AST.  gg/mlp is written in pure Lua, and lua2c
otherwise does not depend on Metalua.  gg/mlp from metalua-0.4.1-rc1
is included in the lib folder.

== Related Work

A related effort luatoc by Hisham Muhammad[2] converts Lua bytecodes
to C source.  lua2c will likely run into the same limitations concerning
coroutines, upvalues, and tail calls.

luagen++[3] uses C++ expression templates to translate Lua-like C++
statements to C API calls.  The code generation is actually fairly
similar to lua2c.
